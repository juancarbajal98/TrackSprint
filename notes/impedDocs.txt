Here is where I will document all the times I come across
an impediment and will document what I use to solve it (links, thoughts, etc)

#1. First thing was that I had to delete this 'main' branch on github
    - for some reason github is making this main branch the default one soon
    - used to master so changed that to default and deleted main
    - used this to learn how to delete branches remotely:

#2. Resizing button font was causing my button to resize and change position
    - Found out this has to do with the default vertical-align that buttons have
    - used this to fix:
