Here is where I will document all the times I come across
an impediment and will document what I use to solve it (links, thoughts, etc)

#1. First thing was that I had to delete this 'main' branch on github
    - for some reason github is making this main branch the default one soon
    - used to master so changed that to default and deleted main
    - used this to learn how to delete branches remotely:

#2. Resizing button font was causing my button to resize and change position
    - Found out this has to do with the default vertical-align that buttons have
    - used this to fix:

#3 How to open a file in my current workspace on a new window? Wanted to have notes on another window..
    - Found the 2-step shortcut for this on stackoverflow: cmmd + k => o 
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43362133/visual-studio-code-open-tab-in-new-window

#4 Wanting to center my add and edit buttons on the new sprint page in their respective div
    - Little bit hard-coded, but involved creating divs for the button container and setting
      positioning attributes correctly.

#5 Making a pill-shaped div/button with CSS
    - found a codepen page with a small div example
    - extrapolated the ratio they used from height/border-radius b/c border radius was a pixel value
    - found it to be 1.33 * height => perfect pill shape :)
